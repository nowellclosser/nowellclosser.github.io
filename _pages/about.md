I'm a third-year PhD Student in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu) at Harvard, advised by [Prof. Susan Murphy](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/).  I'm interested in Reinforcement Learning (RL), and in particular implementing and analyzing RL algorithms in real settings.

Before starting my PhD, I spent 9 years working at a variety of startups as a software engineer, often doing data engineering, and sometimes doing it with large amounts of data.  Five of those years were spent living in beautiful Revelstoke, BC.
